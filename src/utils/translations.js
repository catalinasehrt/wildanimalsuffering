However, the reason to help them is that they need our help, not because we caused their situation. We can see that this argument would also apply to humans in distant places suffering from natural causes, such as earthquakes or hurricanes. If we think we should help humans in those cases and care about their wellbeing as sentient beings, then it follows that we should help animals living in the wild as well.',

We know suffering feels bad to us. But we also know that suffering feels bad for a dog or a cat. And we also know that suffering feels bad for a pig, a chicken or a fish. Suffering feels bad for anyone who feels it, regardless of their species or their location. When you put yourselves into the perspective of the one who suffers, it doesn’t matter whether they are in a house, a farm, or a forest. Their suffering matters. It matters to them. And it should matter to us.',

There is much to learn about the situation of wild animals. This page is just an introduction to the issue. In truth, it is very sad that so many animals are desperately in need of help right now. But luckily, humans like you have the opportunity to make a difference. We hope you choose to take it.',
