      "Starvation is a common cause of death for animals who survive to old age. Food scarcity is worsened by the simultaneous occurrence of hunger and predation. Thirst is another major contributor to high mortality rates in wild animals. The combination of thirst and starvation accelerates the process of dehydration that culminates in death. Many animals who live in arid conditions continue to eat as a survival strategy because there are some fluids in food. This allows animals to remain alive for longer. Without the availability of water directly or indirectly through food, many animals do not survive harsh climates.",
